# nf-core/eager: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [FastQC](#fastqc) - Raw read QC
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `preprocessing/`
  - `fastqc_raw/`
    - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics of input FASTQs.
    - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.
  - `fastqc_processed/`
    - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics of pipeline preprocessed FASTQs.
    - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

FastQC results in the `raw/` directory contain the results of running FastQC on the 'raw' input files (with no processing by the pipeline). The `processed/` directory is for reads run through either fastp or AdapterRemoval preprocessing, and therefore will only be present if preprocessing is executed. These FastQC results occur in both html (the report) and .zip format (raw data).

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.

### Preprocessing

#### AdapterRemoval

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `preprocessing/`
  - `*.settings`: Log file of the AdapterRemoval execution containing trimming, merging, and other read summary statistics.
  - `*.truncated.fastq.gz`: Final FASTQ file of single-end data that have undergone quality trimming. These are the final reads used downstream for single-end data.
  - `*.merged.fastq.gz`: Final FASTQ file of paired-end data that have undergone quality trimming, and merging. Typically a concatenated file of the `*collapsed*` files. May, or may not include unmerged reads (singletons), depending on your parameters. These are the final reads used downstream for paired-end data.
  - `*.pair{1,2}.truncated.fastq.gz`: Final FASTQ file(s) containing paired-end reads that have undergone additional quality trimming but _not_ merging. These are the final reads used downstream for paired-end data when merging is skipped. Only present for paired-end libraries.
  - `*_collapsed.fastq.gz`: FASTQ file containing merged reads of paired-end libraries that have not had trimming performed.
  - `*_collapsed.truncated.fastq.gz`: FASTQ file containing merged reads that have had additional quality trimming performed.
  - `*_discarded.fastq.gz`: FASTQ file containing merged reads that did not pass other quality thresholds (e.g. minimum length).
  - `*.truncated.fastq.gz`: FASTQ file(s) containing umerged reads that have undergone additional quality trimming. Only present for paired-end libraries.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[AdapterRemoval](https://adapterremoval.readthedocs.io/) removes residual adapter sequences from single-end (SE) or paired-end (PE) FASTQ reads, optionally trimming Ns and low qualities bases and/or collapsing overlapping paired-end mates into one read.

The resulting FASTQ files will only be present in your results directory if you run with `--preprocessing_savepreprocessedreads`. The `.settings` log files should always be present if AdapterRemoval has been run.

#### fastp

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `preprocessing/`

  - `*.{log,html,json}`: Log files of the AdapterRemoval execution containing trimming, merging, and other read summary statistics. The three files contain the same information stored in different formats.
  - `*.merged.fastq.gz`: Final FASTQ file of paired-end data that have undergone quality trimming, and merging. May, or may not include unmerged reads (singletons), depending on your parameters. These are the final reads used downstream for paired-end data.
  - `*.fastp.fastq.gz`: Final FASTQ file of single-end data that have undergone quality trimming. These are the final reads used downstream for single-end data.
  - `*_{1,2}.fastp.fastq.gz`: Final FASTQ file(s) containing paired-end reads that have had undergone additional quality trimming but _not_ merging. These are the final reads used downstream for paired-end data when merging is skipped. Only present for paired-end libraries.

  </details>

[fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) is an all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor (QC/adapters/trimming/filtering/splitting/merging etc.)

The resulting FASTQ files will only be present in your results directory if you run with `--preprocessing_savepreprocessedreads`. The various log files should always be present if fastp has been run.

### Mapping

#### BWA

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `mapping/`

  - `*.bam`: Reads aligned against a reference genome in BAM format with no additional filtering.
  - `*.{bai,csi}`: Index file corresponding to a BAM file which is for faster downstream steps (e.g. SAMtools).
  - `*.flagstat`: Statistics of aligned reads from SAMtools `flagstat`.

  </details>

  [BWA](https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml) is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms: BWA-backtrack (a.k.a `bwa aln`), BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads.

### BAM Filtering

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `bam_filtering/`

  - `*length.filtered.bam`: BAM file containing length-filtered mapped and unmapped reads.
  - `*.filtered.bam`: BAM file containing mapped quality filtered reads (and optionally length filtering and unmapped reads, if specified by the user with the corresponding parameters).
  - `*.{bai,csi}`: Corresponding index files of any generated BAM files.
  - `*.unmapped_other_{1,2,other,singleton}.fastq.gz`: FASTQ file containing only unmapped reads, if specified for generation, without length filtering.
    - If you do read merging or have single-end data you will only get one file containing (`*_other*`) containg all reads (the others will be empty).
    - If you skip merging for _paired-end data_ you'll get reads separately (`_1`, `_2`, `_singleton`), with `other` being empty.
  - `*mapped_{1,2,other,singleton}.fastq.gz`: FASTQ file containing only mapped reads, if specified for generation, without length or quality filtering. If you do read merging you will only get one file containing (`*_other*`) containg all reads. If you skip merging you'll get them separately (`_1`, `_2` etc.).
  - `*filtered.flagstat`: Statistics of aligned reads from SAMtools `flagstat`.

</details>

nf-core/eager can perform a range of different length, quality, and/or mapped-unmmapped filtering of BAM files, and generate converted FASTQ files for manual analysis outside the pipeline.

If bam filtering is turned on, by default only mapped reads are retained for downstream genomic analysis. Additionally, please note that removal of PCR duplicates in nf-core/eager will additionally filter for mapped reads only.

Please be aware, that intermediate length and mapping quality filtered genomic BAM files are _not_ saved in the results directory automatically, with the assumption that downstream deduplicated BAM files are preferred for further analyses - see the [parameters](https://nf-co.re/eager/parameters) page for more information if you wish to save these.

You may also recieve the files above if metagenomic screening is turned on.

### Deduplication

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `deduplication/`

  - `*.dedupped.bam`: Unique reads aligned to a reference genome in BAM format.
  - `*.dedupped.bam.{bai,csi}`: Index file corresponding to the BAM file.
  - `*.dedupped.flagstat`: Statistics of aligned reads from SAMtools `flagstat`, after removal of PCR duplicates.

</details>bam,bai,csi

Deduplication is carried by two possible tools, as described below. However the expected output files are should be the same.

#### picard MarkDuplicates

[Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) is a toolkit for general BAM file manipulation with many different functions. nf-core/eager most visibly uses the 'markduplicates' tool, for the removal of exact PCR duplicates that can occur during library amplification and results in false inflated coverages (and overly-confident genotyping calls).

#### DeDup

[DeDup](https://github.com/apeltzer/DeDup) is a merged-read deduplication tool capable of performing merged-read deduplication on paired-end sequencing data in BAM files.

#### Preseq

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `mapping/`

  - `*.c_curve.txt`: A file for every BAM file that had enough deduplication statistics to generate a complexity curve for estimating the amount unique reads that will be yield if the library is re-sequenced. You can use this file for plotting e.g. in R to find your sequencing target depth.

  </details>

  [Preseq](https://github.com/smithlabcode/preseq) Preseq is a collection of tools that allow assessment of the complexity of the library, where complexity means the number of unique molecules in your library (i.e. not molecules with the exact same length and sequence). There are two algorithms from the tools we use: c_curve and lc_extrap. The former gives you the expected number of unique reads if you were to repeated sequencing but with fewer reads than your first sequencing run. The latter tries to extrapolate the decay in the number of unique reads you would get with re-sequencing but with more reads than your initial sequencing run.
