## Introduction

**nf-core/eager** is a scalable and reproducible bioinformatics best-practise processing pipeline for genomic NGS sequencing data, with a focus on ancient DNA (aDNA) data. It is ideal for the (palaeo)genomic analysis of humans, animals, plants, microbes and even microbiomes.

## Pipeline summary

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

- (Optionally) create reference genome indices for mapping (`bwa`, `samtools`, and `picard`)
- Sequencing quality control (`FastQC`, `Falco`)
- Sequencing adapter removal, paired-end data merging (`AdapterRemoval`)
- Read mapping to reference using (`bwa aln`, `bwa mem`, `CircularMapper`, or `bowtie2`)
- Post-mapping processing, statistics and conversion to bam (`samtools`, and `preseq`)
- Ancient DNA C-to-T damage pattern visualisation (`DamageProfiler`)
- PCR duplicate removal (`DeDup` or `MarkDuplicates`)
- Post-mapping statistics and BAM quality control (`Qualimap`)
- Library Complexity Estimation (`preseq`)
- Overall pipeline statistics summaries (`MultiQC`)

### Additional Steps

Additional functionality contained by the pipeline currently includes:

#### Input

- Automatic merging of complex sequencing setups (e.g. multiple lanes, sequencing configurations, library types)

#### Preprocessing

- Illumina two-coloured sequencer poly-G tail removal (`fastp`)
- Post-AdapterRemoval trimming of FASTQ files prior mapping (`fastp`)
- Automatic conversion of unmapped reads to FASTQ (`samtools`)
- Host DNA (mapped reads) stripping from input FASTQ files (for sensitive samples)

#### aDNA Damage manipulation

- Damage removal/clipping for UDG+/UDG-half treatment protocols (`BamUtil`)
- Damaged reads extraction and assessment (`PMDTools`)
- Nuclear DNA contamination estimation of human samples (`angsd`)

#### Genotyping

- Creation of VCF genotyping files (`GATK UnifiedGenotyper`, `GATK HaplotypeCaller` and `FreeBayes`)
- Creation of EIGENSTRAT genotyping files (`pileupCaller`)
- Creation of Genotype Likelihood files (`angsd`)
- Consensus sequence FASTA creation (`VCF2Genome`)
- SNP Table generation (`MultiVCFAnalyzer`)

#### Biological Information

- Mitochondrial to Nuclear read ratio calculation (`MtNucRatioCalculator`)
- Statistical sex determination of human individuals (`Sex.DetERRmine`)

#### Metagenomic Screening

- Low-sequenced complexity filtering (`BBduk` or `PRINSEQ++`)
- Taxonomic binner with alignment (`MALT` or `MetaPhlAn 4`)
- Taxonomic binner without alignment (`Kraken2`,`KrakenUniq`)
- aDNA characteristic screening of taxonomically binned data from MALT (`MaltExtract`)

#### Functionality Overview

A graphical overview of suggested routes through the pipeline depending on context can be seen below.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.tsv`:

```csv
ample_id	library_id	lane	colour_chemistry	pairment	strandedness	damage_treatment	r1	r2	bam	bam_reference_id
sample1	sample1_a	1	4	paired	double	none	/<path>/<to>/sample1_a_l1_r1.fq.gz /<path>/<to>/sample1_a_l1_r2.fq.gz	NA	NA
sample2	sample2_a	2	2	single	double	full	/<path>/<to>/sample2_a_l1_r1.fq.gz	NA	NA	NA
sample3	sample3_a	8	4	single	double	half	NA	NA	/<path>/<to>/sample31_a.bam	Mammoth_MT_Krause
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end), pair of fastq files (paired end), and/or a bam file.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/eager \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --fasta  '<your_reference>.fasta' \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/eager/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/eager/parameters).
